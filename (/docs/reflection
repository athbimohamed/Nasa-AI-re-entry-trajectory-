1.  learned that GitHub comes in handy when it comes to following changes in the code. Branches enable me to work on other parts of the project without destroying the initial code. It also keeps a record of all the changes via the commits, so I can always switch back to an older version if something goes wrong. Pull requests come in handy for checking changes before merging to ensure nothing gets destroyed.
2. The most difficult aspect was getting the branches working well and minimizing conflict during pulling and merging the requests. It was enjoyable to see how much simpler everything works in GitHub even if one works independently.
