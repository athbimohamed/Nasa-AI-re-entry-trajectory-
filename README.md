# Nasa-AI-re-entry-trajectory-
Real-time spacecraft re-entry trajectory calculator using AI
# Project Idea 
This AI model will help automate NASA's re-entry calculation to adjust spacecraft trajectory in real time. The use of AI in trajectory calculations will add significant value to NASA's missions by reducing calculation errors while delivering fast trajectory calculations. Re-entry calculations are crucial for spacecraft to adjust trajectory, which depends on many factors including angle of re-entry, weather conditions, and speed. This AI model will help automate calculations while reducing errors and providing fast results. It will combine machine learning algorithms with physics equations to adjust trajectory in real time while considering different variables including angle of re-entry, weather conditions, blackout period, aerodynamic spacecraft design, and speed.
# Technologies 
The AI model code will be built using Python on VSCode, which is best for building AI models. An AI model framework will be constructed using a neural network approach to predict trajectories, and the use of data-handling technology like WebSockets to deal with data in real time.
